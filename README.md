# portfolio-website

This website portfolio is a portal to showcase some of my core programming capabilities.

The first version of this website included static HTML, CSS and minimal JS. For additional functionalities and to future proof the site was in September 2021 converted to React.

Future updates will include videos of Apps and updated projects.

The website portfolio is live [here](https://christopher-1989.github.io/react-portfolio-website/)
